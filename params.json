{"name":"Castor","tagline":"PHP-Webframework","body":"### Welcome\r\nCastor, a small solid Web-Framework written in PHP.\r\n\r\nThe build in classes couldt give a high scalable background for your own MVC or whatever concept.\r\nA xml-configuration couldt describe a complete homepage and works powerfull with XSLT-Templates.\r\nServeral additions to add constants and individual modules, prepares a data-model for a page.\r\n\r\n### The name\r\nPHP Castor does not relate to the more specific java framework.\r\nIts just an odd coincidence, that i decide to name it like an other object oriented data binding framework for similar-sounding webapplications.\r\nA reassimilation is possible and couldt happen if a community grounds up.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\nAs the productive base, a specific class phtmlDocument or xsltDocument will extend the main class that loads controller classes that extend Application objects.\r\nData, prepared by modules and \"document elements\", feeds controller classes with elements given for a action.\r\nThe data as array, DomDocument object or plaintext, couldt served and adopt in serveral data formats like xml and json.\r\nA little copy paste of the action configuration, transforms the hole base code from a dynamic page to an asynchronous service.\r\n\r\n### The Goal\r\nThe idea, to describe a page with a xml config-file is allready the goal of the project.\r\nA plugin system shouldt extend tags to describe simple interactions for and from the view.\r\nAlso system plugins shouldt extend the baseline of the system.\r\nThe framework will equipped with some simple modules for typical jobs of PHP-Engineers.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nYou can found a skeleton application in example/, several prepared modules as well as a reference follows as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@ngohr published this in Nov 2014, everybody couldt use the files in this repository but rights are reserved to himself.\r\nIf a licence is necessary in the future, the nonrestrictive use of the code couldt revoked by him.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact me on GitHub\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
